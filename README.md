0. Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. Print the array after each time you swap two elements. In the 0-O file, write the big O notations of the best, average, and worst case of the bubble sort algo.
1. Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the insert sort algorithm. Do not modifying the integer n of a node. Print the list after each swap. In 1-O write big O notations of best, average, and worst case of the insertion sort algo.
2. Same as above, but with the selection sort algorithm. 
3. Same, but with quicksort algorith,. 

Potential additions include: shell sort, cocktail shaker sort, counting sort, merge sort, heap sort, and radix sort.
